# Developing your ArcGIS Native Applications With WebMaps

![banner_webmap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36415565/213777640-b5005e66-20ba-4bbc-9a95-5e53fc847715.png)

Here lies the source code that I used in my ArcGIS Blog [Five tips for developing your native applications using web maps](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/maps-sdk/developers/five-tips-for-developing-your-native-applications-using-web-maps).

I use the [ArcGIS Runtime API for iOS](https://developers.arcgis.com/ios/) to demonstrate how to include an Esri web map (hosted on ArcGIS Online) in a native iPhone application. This demo application also covers error handling and notification, and code demonstrating how to override the web map's style configurations to add your own creative touch to the mobile app. Read the blog for more details!

## Instructions

Requirements: Xcode, internet access

1. Fork and then clone the repo.
2. Open the project with Xcode.
3. Run the app and tap and zoom the map to explore the customised web map.
